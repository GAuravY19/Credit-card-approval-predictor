1. Develop a machine learning model to predict credit card approval outcomes.
2. Explore the relationship between applicant characteristics and credit card approval decisions.
3. Assess the performance of the predictive model using relevant evaluation metrics.
4. Gain insights into the key factors influencing credit card approval.

### Installation
<hr>
Here's a step-by-step guide for installing and running the project from GitHub on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
